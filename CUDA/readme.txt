- clone it inside C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\NVIDIA GPU Computing SDK 3.2
   so you don't need to copy libraries
   
SPH implementation of the following dynamic problems:

- Fluid (incompressible Navier–Stokes)
	+ normalized density
	- acceleration limit	
	
- Beam (isotropic console beam)
	- not stable(wait ~30 sec to see) 	
	
- Fluid + Beam
	prototype is under construction.
